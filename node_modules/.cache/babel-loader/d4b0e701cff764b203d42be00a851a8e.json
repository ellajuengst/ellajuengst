As everyone has different levels of comfort, users will use a slider to select where exactly they fall on the spectrum from “Not at All Comfortable” to “Totally Comfortable” for activities with varying levels of exposure risk. After submitting their information, users will be placed into one of three categories: Low, Medium, and High Risk Tolerance. An individual’s Risk Tolerance is indicated on their public profile, so other users can find people with similar comfort levels in the search pages. The contract building section of the app uses the information from the users’ initial surveys to create a baseline contract that compromises between each user's responses. If users have different ideas regarding safety, the app will tend to favor users with lower risk tolerance when creating the contract. Users can edit their generated contract to more specifically fit their needs by adding, removing, or changing guidelines.\"\n  }]\n}];\nexport default

Users then complete a “Personal Risk Evaluation” to determine if they have any preexisting conditions, and a “Comfort Assessment,” to determine their risk tolerance. As everyone has different levels of comfort, users will use a slider to select where exactly they fall on the spectrum from “Not at All Comfortable” to “Totally Comfortable” for activities with varying levels of exposure risk. After submitting their information, users will be placed into one of three categories: Low, Medium, and High Risk Tolerance. An individual’s Risk Tolerance is indicated on their public profile, so other users can find people with similar comfort levels in the search pages. The contract building section of the app uses the information from the users’ initial surveys to create a baseline contract that compromises between each user's responses. If users have different ideas regarding safety, the app will tend to favor users with lower risk tolerance when creating the contract. Users can edit their generated contract to more specifically fit their needs by adding, removing, or changing guidelines.\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n]\n\n\n\nexport default projects;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
